# Program#2
## Description
Using rv/RISC-V, write and test a program that finds prime numbers. Your program should prompt the user to input an integer n ("How many primes?") and then output the first n primes (not primes up to n,) starting at 2.

## Notes
- You may assume that `n`>=some small value (if so, indicate that in your prompt)
- Output one prime number per line
- Determination of prime numbers must be performed by a function named "`test_prime`"(parameter: `n`, an integer) return: `true` or `false` (`1` or `0`)
