### 4.5.1
Every instruction has an "instruction fetch cycle" which fetches the instruction from memory. Additionally, the `lw` and `sw` instructions access memory in the "data access cycle" and those instructions make up 35% of the total instructions. Therefore:
$$\frac{1}{5} + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{7}{20} \right) = \frac{27}{100} \Rightarrow 27\%$$

this is wrong ^
