# Program#1
## Description 
Using rv/RISC-V, write and test a program that repeatedly inputs integers. The program should stop when it gets an input that is zero (so that means that the zero itself is not an input value), printing out the sum and the maximum value of all of  the values that were input (label your outputs, two lines.)  Use the rv/RISC-V system calls that we described in class (output int, input int, output string.) if no values were entered (i.e. the first input is a zero) then output "no input."

## Notes
- you do not need to worry about overflow
